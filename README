README for 0.20.0 Alpha cvBlob.


1. DOWNLOAD LATEST SOURCE

You need Subversion ( http://subversion.tigris.org ).

Read only checkout:

	svn checkout http://cvblob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cvblob-read-only


2. DEPENDENCIES

In order to compile cvBlob you need the following:

	* CMAKE ( http://www.cmake.org )
	* OpenCV ( http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net )

2.1 Instalation of dependencies in Debian type SO (Ubuntu,...) using apt:

If you are in a Debian style distribution (Ubuntu, for example) you can do something
like this:

	sudo aptitude install cmake libcv4 libcv-dev libcvaux4

2.2 Instalation of dependencies in SuSE using Yast

Type this:

	su -c "yast -i libopencv1 opencv opencv-debuginfo opencv-debugsource opencv-devel opencv-python cmake cmake-gui"


3. COMPILING AND INSTALLING

In Linux, if you have unpacked the source in $CVBLOB, enter in a console:

	cd $CVBLOB
	cmake .
	make
	sudo make install

In Windows it must be as easy as in Linux (changing "make" for the equivalent in your compiler).
If problems, please read:
	http://www.cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html

3.1 OpenCV path

You can tell CMake where OpenCV is installed, in case it can't find it, using the "OpenCV_DIR" variable:

	cmake . -DOpenCV_DIR=<path_to_OpenCV>

3.2 Installation path

To change the destination path for the installation, set "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" variable:

	cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path>
